    description: "Microsoft Access is a helpful computer program used for organizing and managing information. It works like a digital filing cabinet where you can store large amounts of data in an organized way. With Access, you can create tables to hold information, make forms to enter data more easily, and use reports to show results in a clear and neat format. People use Access in many places like offices, schools, shops, and even personal projects. For example, it can help track inventories, record customer details, manage schedules, and create simple databases for everyday tasks. What makes Access useful is that you don’t need to be a programmer to use it. Its tools are easy to understand, and it also works well with other Microsoft apps like Excel and Word.Overall, Microsoft Access makes storing and finding information faster, simpler, and more organized."

    short: "Basic HTML webpage structure and styling.",
    description: "we were tasked to create a basic webpage using HTML to demonstrate our understanding of fundamental web development concepts. In this project, we built a simple webpage structure using essential HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists. The activity helped us learn how each HTML tag works and how a webpage is organized, allowing us to apply creativity while gaining hands-on experience with building a webpage from scratch."

    short: "Making network cables using the RJ-45 standard.",
    description: "For our activity titled “Build-A-Cable: RJ-45 Edition,” we were tasked to create both RJ-45 cables using the T568A and T568B wiring standards. The project helped us understand the correct color coding, proper arrangement of wires, and the steps in crimping Ethernet cables. Through this hands-on task, we learned how network cables are made, how each wiring standard differs, and how proper assembly ensures stable network connectivity."

    short: "Interpreting Binary into Hexadecimals etc.",
    description: "For our activity titled “Binary Code Interpreter,” we were tasked to convert and interpret binary numbers into other number systems such as hexadecimal, octal, and decimal. This project helped us understand how different bases work, how data is represented in computers, and how to perform accurate conversions between number systems. Through this task, we strengthened our skills in analyzing binary values and applying mathematical methods to translate them into various formats used in computing.."

    short: "Writing algorithms for system processes.",
    description: "For our activity titled “Algorithm of the System,” we were tasked to create algorithms for performing different simple tasks by mirroring how real system algorithms work. This project allowed us to practice writing step-by-step procedures, understand how systems process inputs, and learn how logical sequencing leads to correct outputs. Through this task, we improved our ability to design clear, structured, and efficient algorithms that can be applied to basic operations and real-world computing processes."

    short: "Creating flowcharts for system design.",
    description: "For our activity titled “System Flowchart,” we were tasked to create five different flowcharts based on the algorithms provided by our teacher. This project allowed us to visualize each algorithm’s logical sequence, understand how data flows through a system, and represent steps using the correct flowchart symbols. By translating written algorithms into graphical form, we improved our understanding of process design, problem-solving, and how systems operate from input to output."
